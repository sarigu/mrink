        Hello, we are "Mr. Ink" (one day we talked about ink fish). We are a
        young band based in Hamburg, Germany. Our music is influenced by Jazz,
        Indie, Pop and Alternative. However, we don't like to put a label on our
        music, instead we like to experiment with our sound. We have four band
        members: Toni, Josef, Sven and Jojo. We like to get together to make
        music. Get to know us a bit more below.

              Toni is the singer and songwriter of our band. She likes to listen
              to bands such as The Cure, Beginners and Paolo Nutini. Her song
              writing process is influenced by the emotions surrounding her.
              Toni started making music at a young age due to her unique
              upbringing.

              where he is not playing. If he doesn't work on melodies, you can
              find him in the kitchen as a trainee.
